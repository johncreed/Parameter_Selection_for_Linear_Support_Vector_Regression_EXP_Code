## Folder description
In this experiments, we have three types of solver: grid, particle swarm optimization(pso), and annealing(anl).

- grid approach is in [grid-approach](grid-approach)
- pso and anl approaches are in [pso-anl-approach](pso-anl-approach)

Read README.md in each folder for instruction.
